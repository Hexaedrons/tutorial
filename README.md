# tutorial
Github repository work in branch. The master is always safe, but edit branches are on-the-work progress, based on master and "to-be-merged" with it.
Commits are saved changes of edit branches, like the history of the branch since it was copied from the master branch. 
So far, so good.
Once modifications have been realized on the edit-branche, one can pull request to merge the brand-new edited branch with the original master. 
If accepted, master is editted accordingly, and the old edited branch can be deleted. 

# Cmd-line. 
git clone url <optional_name>			clone the url on local folder. First everything is clean
						but if modification appear one should realize a pull 
						request to change master branch.

git add file					Add file to the git branch
git commit  					Commit local data to master branch. '-m "my modif was nia
						nia nia" ot precise your commitments. 
git status 					Give current status (clean meaning same as master's) of 
						all files in the git branch.
